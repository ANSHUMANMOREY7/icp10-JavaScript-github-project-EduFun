      <center><h2><i><u>what You know About Computer Network ??</u></i></h2></center>
      <center>  <b><i> A computer network is a system that connects two or more computing devices to enable them to share data, resources, and information, using a set of communication protocols</i></b></center><br>
      <center><b><i>A computer network is a collection of interconnected devices, such as computers, servers, routers, and switches, that communicate with each other to share resources, exchange data, and provide services. Networks are essential for enabling communication between devices across different locations, whether within a local area (LAN) or globally via the internet. The primary goal of a computer network is to facilitate the efficient and secure transmission of data between devices, making it possible for users to access resources, share files, and run applications remotely
        There are several types of computer networks, categorized based on their geographical coverage, topology, and the technologies used to establish connections:
        Local Area Network (LAN): A LAN is a network confined to a small geographic area, such as a home, office, or campus. It typically connects computers, printers, and other devices within a limited space, offering high-speed data transfer and resource sharing. LANs can be wired (using Ethernet cables) or wireless (using Wi-Fi).
        Wide Area Network (WAN): A WAN spans a much larger geographic area, often connecting devices across cities, countries, or even continents. The internet is the largest example of a WAN, where millions of devices are interconnected. WANs typically rely on leased telecommunications lines and use technologies like fiber optics, satellite links, and cellular networks for data transmission.
        Metropolitan Area Network (MAN): A MAN covers a larger area than a LAN but smaller than a WAN, typically serving a city or a large campus. It provides high-speed connections and can be used to link multiple LANs within a specific geographical region, such as connecting different buildings within a city.
        Personal Area Network (PAN): A PAN is a small-scale network that connects devices within an individualâ€™s immediate vicinity, such as smartphones, laptops, and tablets. It typically operates using Bluetooth or Wi-Fi and is designed for personal use, allowing devices to exchange data over short distances.
