      <center><h2><i><u>what You know About  Criminal Law ??</u></i></h2></center>
      <center>  <b><i>The principle of legality is recognized in almost all legal systems throughout the world as the keystone of the criminal law. It is employed in four senses. The first is that there can be no crime without a rule of law; thus, immoral or antisocial conduct not forbidden and punished by law is not criminal. The law may be customary, as in some common-law countries; in most countries, however, the only source of criminal law is a statute (nullum crimen sine lege, “no crime without a law”)
        Second, the principle of legality directs that criminal statutes be interpreted strictly and that they not be applied by analogical extension. If a criminal statute is ambiguous in its meaning or application, it is often given a narrow interpretation favourable to the accused. This does not mean that the law must be interpreted literally if to do so would defeat the clear purpose of the statute. The Model Penal Code incorporates a provision that was enacted in some U.S. state laws. The code recommends that its provisions be construed “according to the fair import of their terms,” which comes closer to the European practice.
        Third, the principle of legality forbids the application of the law retroactively. In order that a person may be convicted, a law must have been in effect at the time the act was committed. This aspect of the principle is embodied in the ex post facto provisions of the U.S. Constitution and such international treaties as the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (adopted 1950) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (entered into force 1976). It is also embodied in the Rome Statute creating the International Criminal Court (ICC; ratified 2002).

      <center><b><i> Criminal law represents society's formal mechanism for defining prohibited conduct, punishing wrongdoers, and maintaining public order. As a cornerstone of legal systems worldwide, it distinguishes itself from civil law by addressing offenses considered harmful to society as a whole, prosecuted by government entities rather than private parties. This body of law serves four primary functions: retribution (just punishment), deterrence (discouraging future crimes), incapacitation (removing dangerous individuals from society), and rehabilitation (reforming offenders).

      <hr><center><h2>It is not our case that criminal laws do not need revision, but that they do not need unprincipled and unguided amendments. The authors of Codification, Macaulay and the Indian Penal Code suggest first looking into the general principles of criminal law, the language of the IPC, and the rules which should govern its interpretation.
