      <center>  <b><i> OS images in Configuration Manager are stored in the Windows image (WIM) file format. These images are a compressed collection of reference files and folders use to install and configure a new OS on a computer.
                   Many OS deployment scenarios require an OS image.</i></b></center><br>
      <center><b><i>An operating system (OS) is a critical software component that acts as an intermediary between computer hardware and the user. It manages hardware resources like the processor, memory, storage devices, and input/output devices. The primary role of an OS is to provide a stable environment for applications to run while ensuring that these applications do not interfere with one another. It organizes files and manages processes, handles system security, and enables networking.
           The OS also provides a user interface, which can be either command-based (such as in a terminal or command prompt) or graphical (like in Windows, macOS, or Linux). This interface allows users to interact with the system and access various programs and files. Additionally, the OS controls the execution of programs by allocating resources effectively, ensuring that processes are executed in an orderly fashion.
          There are different types of operating systems, including single-user, multi-user, single-tasking, and multi-tasking systems. For instance, Windows, macOS, and Linux are examples of multi-tasking, multi-user operating systems, while embedded operating systems are designed for specialized devices like smartphones or routers. The evolution of operating systems has been essential in making computers more user-friendly, versatile,
          and capable of handling complex tasks efficiently.</i></b></center><hr>
