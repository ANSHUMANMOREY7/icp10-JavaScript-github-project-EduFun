      <center><h2><i><u>what You know About Pharmaceutics ??</u></i></h2></center>
      <center>  <b><i> Pharmaceutics is the branch of pharmacy that deals with the formulation, preparation, and dispensing of drugs. It focuses on transforming a new chemical entity (NCE) or drug molecule into a form that is safe, effective, and easy for patients to use. This field combines knowledge of chemistry, biology, physics, and engineering to design drug delivery systems that maximize therapeutic effects while minimizing side effects. Pharmaceutics encompasses various aspects, including drug formulation, dosage forms (such as tablets, capsules, creams, and injectables), the stability of drugs, and their release mechanisms. One of the main goals in pharmaceutics is to optimize the bioavailability of a drug, ensuring that it is absorbed and reaches the targeted site in the body at the right concentration and time. 

        Pharmaceutical scientists work on creating dosage forms that are stable, reproducible, and suitable for different routes of administration, whether oral, parenteral, transdermal, or others. They also study the processes involved in the manufacturing, packaging, and storage of pharmaceuticals to ensure they maintain their potency and safety. Another important area within pharmaceutics is the development of controlled-release formulations, which release the active ingredient gradually over time to provide sustained therapeutic effects, improve patient compliance, and reduce the frequency of administration. Additionally, pharmaceutics plays a critical role in the development of novel drug delivery systems, such as nanomedicines, which allow for targeted therapy and improved drug efficacy. Overall, pharmaceutics bridges the gap between drug discovery and patient care, ensuring that medications are delivered effectively and safely. </i></b></center><br>

      <center>  <b><i> What is the content of pharmaceutics?<br>
        Pharmaceutics is the overall process of developing a new chemical entity into an approved therapy that is safe and effective in treating or preventing disease. It is a complex process requiring multiple scientific, medical, legal, commercial, and regulatory expertise.
