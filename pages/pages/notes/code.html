<center><h2><i><u>what You know About c and cpp language ??</u></i></h2></center>
<center>  <b><i>C vs C++ is a popular blog topic among developers. C and C++ are programming languages that can be used for developing applications such as game development, GUI applications,
     operating system, databases, etc. The C programming language is known as the God of programming languages, whereas C++ is an extended version of C. 
     They have given so much to the programmers that picking one of them over the other will be difficult!</i></b></center><br>
<center><b><i> C++ was also known as “C with Classes,” which is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language. Bjarne Stroustrup developed this language in 1979. 
    It is a multi-paradigm programming language as it supports both procedural and object-oriented programming languages.
     C++ has the property of the C programming language along with the classes and objects for user-defined data types. C++ is used with graphics applications, operating systems, smartwatches, game development, cloud distributed system, compilers, etc.
     Today, C++ has been used by top tech giants companies such as Google, Meta, Amazon, and many more. Now, it is not only an extension of the C programming language, but with a modern update and high performance, it has become a popular and in-demand programming language.
    Looking to improve your C++ programming skills? Check out these free C++ courses! Taught by experienced developers, 
    these courses cover everything from basic syntax to advanced topics like object-oriented programming and memory management. </i></b></center><hr>
<center><b><i></i>C is a structural or procedural programming language that was developed by Computer Scientist Dennis Ritchie in 1972 at Bell Laboratories. 
    C is a basic programming language that can be used to develop an operating system such as Windows, Apple OS X to complex programs like Oracle Database, MySQL, Adobe, Python interpreter, Git, etc. 
    Being procedural language C does not support Objects or Classes.
    C has become popular because of its execution speed, simplicity, and flexibility. It became the base for many other programming languages. 
   If a user knows C, then it is easy for them to learn all other programming languages. C is a case-sensitive language which means small letters and capital letters are treated differently.

<center><b><i># Differences Between C and C++ ,C and C++ are both widely used programming languages, but they have significant differences:
                           ## Key Differences ##
    1. **Programming Paradigm**
       - C: Procedural language (focuses on functions/procedures)
       - C++: Multi-paradigm (supports procedural, object-oriented, and generic programming) 
    2. **Object-Oriented Features**
       - C: No built-in OOP support
       - C++: Supports classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation
    3. **Standard Libraries**
       - C: Standard C library (stdio.h, stdlib.h, etc.)
       - C++: Includes C libraries plus STL (Standard Template Library) with containers, algorithms, etc.
    4. **Function Overloading**
       - C: Not supported
       - C++: Supports function overloading (multiple functions with same name but different parameters)   
    5. **Exception Handling**
       - C: Uses error codes and errno
       - C++: Supports try-catch blocks for exception handling
    6. **Memory Management**
       - C: Uses malloc(), calloc(), free()
       - C++: Uses new and delete operators (though can still use C-style allocation)
    7. **Input/Output**
       - C: Uses printf(), scanf()
       - C++: Uses streams (cout, cin)
    8. **Namespace Support**
       - C: No namespace support
       - C++: Has namespace feature to avoid name collisions
    9. **Reference Variables**
       - C: Only pointers
       - C++: Both pointers and references
    10. **Default Arguments**
        - C: Not supported
        - C++: Functions can have default parameters
    11. **Templates**
        - C: Not available
        - C++: Supports templates for generic programming
    12. **Inline Functions**
        - C: Only through compiler extensions
        - C++: Built-in support for inline functions
    13. **Type Safety**
        - C: Less strict (e.g., implicit type conversions)
        - C++: More type-safe (though not as strict as some newer languages)
    14. **Compatibility**
        - Most C code can compile in C++ (with some exceptions)
        - C++ code generally won't compile in C
    - Use C for:
      - System programming
      - Embedded systems
      - Performance-critical applications where OOP isn't needed
      - When minimal runtime is required
    - Use C++ for:
      - Applications that benefit from OOP
      - Large-scale software development
      - Applications needing STL containers/algorithms
      - Game development
      - When you want both high-level and low-level control</i></b></center>
