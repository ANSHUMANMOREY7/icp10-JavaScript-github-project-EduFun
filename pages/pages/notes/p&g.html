      <center><h2><i><u>what You know About Polity and Goverance ??</u></i></h2></center>
      <center>  <b><i> The Indian polity is a **federal democratic republic** governed by the **Constitution of India**, adopted on **26th January 1950**. It establishes a **parliamentary system** of government with a **President** as the ceremonial head and a **Prime Minister** as the real executive.  
        India follows a **dual polity** structure—**Union Government** and **State Governments**—with a **separation of powers** among the **Legislature, Executive, and Judiciary**. The **Supreme Court** is the highest judicial authority, ensuring constitutional supremacy.   
        The **Indian Parliament** consists of two houses: the **Lok Sabha (Lower House)** and the **Rajya Sabha (Upper House)**. Members of Lok Sabha are directly elected, while Rajya Sabha members are elected by state legislatures.  
        India is a **secular, socialist, sovereign, and democratic** republic, guaranteeing **Fundamental Rights** (Part III) and enforcing **Directive Principles of State Policy** (Part IV). The **73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendments** introduced **Panchayati Raj** and **Municipalities**, strengthening grassroots democracy.  
        The polity also features an **independent Election Commission**, ensuring free and fair elections, and a **rigid yet flexible** Constitution, amendable under **Article 368**. India’s federal nature is balanced with a **strong central bias**, especially during emergencies.  
        Thus, Indian polity reflects a **unique blend of federalism, democracy, and constitutional governance**, adapting to socio-political changes while upholding the rule of law.</i></b></center><br>
