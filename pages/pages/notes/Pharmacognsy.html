      <center><h2><i><u>what You know About Pharmacognsy ??</u></i></h2></center>
      <center>  <b><i> Pharmacognosy is the branch of pharmacy that deals with the study of natural products, particularly those derived from plants, animals, and minerals, and their potential use in medicine. It combines aspects of botany, chemistry, biology, and pharmacology to understand the therapeutic properties of these natural substances. Pharmacognosy is essential in the discovery of new drugs, as many pharmaceutical agents have been derived from natural sources throughout history.
        The primary focus of pharmacognosy is to explore the medicinal properties of plant-derived compounds, known as phytochemicals, which include alkaloids, flavonoids, terpenoids, and glycosides. These substances have been used for centuries in traditional medicine systems worldwide, and ongoing research continues to identify their pharmacological effects, such as antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, or anticancer properties.
        In addition to plants, pharmacognosy also examines substances from other natural sources like marine organisms, fungi, and even minerals, which can serve as the basis for new drug development. The process involves the extraction, isolation, identification, and characterization of bioactive compounds, followed by the study of their mechanisms of action in the body.
        Pharmacognosy is a multidisciplinary field that requires knowledge in chemistry, biology, pharmacology, and technology. Researchers in pharmacognosy work to ensure that natural medicines are safe, effective, and of high quality, with rigorous standards for their production and use. Moreover, it contributes to the development of herbal medicines, dietary supplements, and other natural therapeutic products that are commonly used around the world. With growing interest in alternative and complementary medicine, pharmacognosy continues to play a critical role in the advancement of modern medicine. </i></b></center><br>
