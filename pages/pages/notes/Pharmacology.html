      <center><h2><i><u>what You know About Pharmacology.??</u></i></h2></center>
      <center>  <b><i> Pharmacology is the branch of medicine and biology that focuses on the study of drugs and their effects on living organisms. It encompasses both the therapeutic use and the potential harmful effects of drugs. Pharmacologists study how drugs interact with the body, how they are absorbed, distributed, metabolized, and excreted—known as pharmacokinetics—and how they produce their effects at the molecular, cellular, and organ levels, which is referred to as pharmacodynamics. The effects of drugs depend on their chemical properties, the way the body processes them, and the specific receptors or enzymes they target. Therapeutic drugs are designed to promote healing, alleviate symptoms, or prevent disease, but they can also have side effects or cause toxicity, especially if used improperly or in high doses. Additionally, pharmacology plays a crucial role in drug development, from understanding disease mechanisms to the clinical testing of new medications. With advancements in biotechnology, pharmacology continues to evolve, leading to more personalized treatments and the development of targeted therapies that can improve patient outcomes and minimize side effects. Ultimately, pharmacology serves as the foundation for modern medicine, offering insights that guide the safe and effective use of drugs in clinical practice. </i></b></center><br>
      <center><b><i>Pharmacology is the science of drugs and medications,[1] including a substance's origin, composition, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, therapeutic use, and toxicology. More specifically, it is the study of the interactions that occur between a living organism and chemicals that affect normal or abnormal biochemical function.[2] If substances have medicinal properties, they are considered pharmaceuticals.
        The field encompasses drug composition and properties, functions, sources, synthesis and drug design, molecular and cellular mechanisms, organ/systems mechanisms, signal transduction/cellular communication, molecular diagnostics, interactions, chemical biology, therapy, and medical applications and antipathogenic capabilities. The two main areas of pharmacology are pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics. Pharmacodynamics studies the effects of a drug on biological systems, and pharmacokinetics studies the effects of biological systems on a drug. In broad terms, pharmacodynamics discusses the chemicals with biological </i></b></center><hr>
